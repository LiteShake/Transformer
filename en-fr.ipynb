      "Light enters through the cornea and is projected onto the retina, which consists of cells that are sensitive to electromagnetic radiation.\n",
      "From there, the light signals are converted into electrical impulses that are transmitted to the brain along the optic nerve.\n",
      "Once the brain has received the pulses, it transforms the information into an image.\n",
      "The human eye is spherical and its internal parts are transparent so that the maximum amount of light can reach the retina.\n",
      "The cornea surrounds and protects the eye.\n",
      "It is made of transparent gel-like material that helps converge light rays onto the retina.\n",
      "The role of the iris is to control the quantity of light that passes through the cornea, keeping it at a fairly constant level.\n",
      "Too much light can damage the retina, whereas not enough will prevent a person from seeing properly.\n",
      "Its centre, the pupil, allows just the right amount of light to pass through so that we can see.\n",
      "This is why the pupil contracts when there is too much light (like when the Sun blinds us) to prevent excess light rays from reaching the retina, and contracts when there is not enough light (like when we walk into a darkened room) to allow in the most light possible.\n",
      "Immediately behind the iris is the lens.\n",
      "It is a true lens in that it converges light rays passing through the eye onto the retina.\n",
      "The lens of the eye is also flexible and can deform itself to improve the convergence of light.\n",
      "On the other hand, they are not very sensitive to light rays and need a lot of light to work.\n",
      "The rods are very sensitive to light and enable us to see when it is dark.\n",
      "They are not, however, capable of distinguishing different colours and details, and this causes the poor colour contrast between objects that we observe when the lighting is dim.\n",
      "In all, hundreds of millions of cells must work together in our eyes and brain in order for us to see.\n",
      "Astronomers « Return to the instruments The first instruments The transit and the sextant\n",
      "Many different astronomical instruments have been used throughout the ages.\n",
      "Two stand out as having played particularly important historical roles: the transit and the sextant.\n",
      "Such diverse fields as stellar cartography (mapping), navigation and the determination of time have all progressed significantly thanks to these instruments.\n",
      "The transit is used to measure the precise moment that a celestial object passes through its highest point in the sky (also know as the meridian).\n",
      "Used since ancient Egyptian time, the modern form of this instrument consists of a telescope that only moves vertically.\n",
      "A dial on one side, graduated from 0 to 90 degrees, is used to measure the inclination of the telescope.\n",
      "When the celestial object in question passes through the meridian, the observer notes its angle above the horizon at the precise moment of its passing.\n",
      "These two measurements provide the coordinates (the position) of the object in the celestial sphere.\n",
      "A map of the sky can be thus be assembled bit by bit and used to create tables that give the positions of stars, planets, the Moon and so on for the purposes of navigation or determining the exact time.\n",
      "The sextant is an instrument that can be used to determine the angle between a celestial object and the horizon.\n",
      "Used in conjunction with the transit tables, it is a simple matter to calculate the latitude of one’s position.\n",
      "The predecessors of the sextant included the astrolab and the octant, both of which operated on the same principle.\n",
      "The modern version of the sextant was independently invented in the 1730’s by John Hadley in England and Thomas Godfrey in the United States.\n",
      "« Return to the instruments Next Previous © 2006 An original idea and a realization of the ASTROLab of Mont-Mégantic National Park\n",
      "Astronomers « Return to the instruments Refracting telescopes Concentrating light by refraction through lenses The Assyrians (people who lived in a region that is known today as Iraq) were perhaps the first to have used lenses to magnify objects, possibly around 1,500 BC.\n",
      "The evidence is a rock crystal discovered by the English archaeologist John Layard in 1850 during the excavation of the ancient city of Nimrud.\n",
      "The crystal was cut and polished into the shape of a lens, however it is not entirely certain that it was used as a magnifying lens and not as jewellery or for some other purpose.\n",
      "Evidence that lenses were in use during the first century BC can be found in the records of the Roman authors Pliny and Senecio who reported that an engraver at Pompeii used a lens to help him in his work.\n",
      "Other historical evidence reveals that the Arabs were using lenses by the year 600 AD, as were the Vikings around the year 900.\n",
      "It is difficult to determine when a refracting telescope was first assembled using lenses.\n",
      "The first person to do so with certainty, and thus the person to be credited with its invention, was the English mathematician Leonard Digges who constructed a refracting telescope sometime between 1540 and 1553 to assist with his topographic surveys.\n",
      "Leonard Digges – or perhaps his son, the English astronomer Thomas Digges – was also the first to turn a refractor towards the sky to study celestial objects.\n",
      "The instrument did not become widely known to the public until 1608 when Hans Lippershey (or Lipperhey), a Dutch optician of German origin, began to make and sell telescopes.\n",
      "Lippershey applied for a patent for what he claimed was his own invention, but was refused on the grounds that the device was already in existence.\n",
      "The English mathematician Thomas Harriot was the first to study the Moon in detail using an astronomical telescope in 1609, and it is known with certainty that this occurred several months before Galileo Galilei, the famous Italian physicist, did the same.\n",
      "Galilei, however, was the first to have published his observations in a book entitled \"The Starry Messenger\" (translated from Latin).\n",
      "His book revolutionized our concept of the Universe.\n",
      "The first refracting telescopes consisted of two lenses separated by some distance within a closed tube.\n",
      "The larger of the two is the objective, or primary lens, and the second is the ocular.\n",
      "The role of the lenses is to concentrate light rays into a single point – the focal point – so as to obtain a sharper magnified image.\n",
      "It is the glass of the lens that allows light to be concentrated.\n",
      "This phenomenon is known as \"refraction\".\n",
      "Lenses, to be effective in a telescope, must be shaped so that all the refracted light rays converge in a single point.\n",
      "Unfortunately, we now know today that it is impossible to focus light from an object into a single point using only one lens.\n",
      "There are several types of aberrations, the main ones being chromatic and spherical.\n",
      "All types of aberration cause deformation of the image transmitted by the telescope.\n",
      "Chromatic aberration occurs because light rays of different colours are not all bent by the same amount as they pass through a lens.\n",
      "Consequently, it is impossible to concentrate the rays into a single point.\n",
      "Chromatic aberration causes coloured fringes to appear around the image.\n",
      "Spherical aberration is due to the shape of the lens.\n",
      "A lens is nothing more than a piece of glass with each surface shaped like a portion of a sphere.\n",
      "Unfortunately, a sphere is not the best shape for concentrating light rays into a single point, but is the easiest shape to make when grinding and polishing glass.\n",
      "Spherical aberration causes images to be blurred.\n",
      "These days, refracting telescopes are made using several lenses that are designed and put together in ways that minimize the problems caused by aberrations.\n",

      "Astronomers « Return to the instruments Reflecting telescopes Concentrating light using mirrors In contrast to a refracting telescope, which uses lenses to enlarge images, reflecting telescopes (also known as reflectors) use mirrors to accomplish the same goal.\n",
      "The advantages are numerous: manufacturing mirrors is simpler and less costly than lenses, there are less aberration-related problems, and the main mirror can be supported from below.\n",
      "Today, the reflecting telescope is considered as one of the most powerful scientific instruments ever invented.\n",
      "Sometime between 1540 and 1553, the English mathematician Leonard Digges constructed the first reflecting telescope using a mirror and a lens.\n",
      "In 1576, his son Thomas, an astronomer, used it to defend the idea that the Universe is infinite, which was a revolutionary concept at the time.\n",
      "Nevertheless, it would be another 100 years before the reflecting telescope was widely used.\n",
      "In 1663, the Scottish mathematician and astronomer James Gregory published his book Optima Promota in which he included the design for a new type of compact reflecting telescope.\n",
      "The English physicist Robert Hooke built the actual instrument several years later, only a short time before Isaac Newton developed his own telescope in 1668.\n",
      "The principle behind Newton’s telescope was so simple that we still use it today.\n",
      "It consists of two mirrors: the primary and the secondary.\n",
      "The primary mirror has a parabolic shape and serves to collect light from the object of interest.\n",
      "The secondary mirror, smaller than the primary, is flat and inclined in such a way as to reflect light from the primary mirror towards the ocular and the observer.\n",
      "In 1672, the Catholic priest and French teacher Laurent Cassegrain invented a new type of reflecting telescope that he described in an unpublished manuscript.\n",
      "The Cassegrain telescope consisted of a primary parabolic mirror, which collected light from the celestial object, and a secondary mirror, which faced the primary mirror and concentrated the reflected light towards the observer by directing it through a hole in the centre of the primary mirror.\n",
      "The image could therefore be viewed from behind the telescope, and not from the side, as with Newton’s design.\n",
      "The big advantage to the Cassegrain design is its compact size, which makes it portable.\n",

      "Astronomers « Return to the instruments Invisible light collectors Seeing the invisible Refracting and reflecting telescopes are used to collect and study visible light.\n",
      "Although visible light provides valuable information, it only represents a tiny portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n",
      "To see the rest of the spectrum, which consists of invisible colours, researchers need to use collectors that are capable of detecting wavelengths that correspond to the type of light they wish to study.\n",
      "For the infrared domain, the parabolic mirror of a reflecting telescope remains the ideal means by which to collect and concentrate the light rays.\n",
      "Because the light being collected is invisible, the human observer is replaced by an infrared detector at the mirror’s focal point.\n",
      "Its purpose is to measure the intensity of the infrared rays.\n",
      "Unfortunately, the situation is considerably more complex for the mid- and far-infrared domains.\n",
      "One of the complications for detecting infrared sources in space is that the reflecting telescope collects a lot of background infrared light from the atmosphere, from any human observers present in the room, and from the telescope itself.\n",
      "In addition, atmospheric water vapour absorbs a large part of the infrared rays coming from space, which makes data collection difficult – or even impossible – at some wavelengths.\n",
      "To overcome these problems, detectors are cooled to very low temperatures (sometimes down to -269 °C) and the telescopes are placed at the highest elevations possible where the air is drier.\n",
      "Another solution is to put them directly into space, orbiting Earth.\n",
      "The great interest for astronomers in observing the infrared light of the Universe is due to its powers of penetration.\n",
      "Infrared waves are capable of passing through dust, allowing us to see regions that are otherwise impenetrable to visible light, such as the interiors of nebulas.\n",
      "At longer wavelengths in the microwave domain, absorption by water is a persistent problem and the best solutions are to collect data from high elevations or satellites.\n",
      "In order for light rays to be concentrated at the focal point of a reflecting telescope, the size of the irregularities in the curve of the parabolic collector must be smaller than the wavelength of the light being collected.\n",
      "Consequently, it is not necessary to use a highly polished reflecting surface like a mirror for light with very long wavelengths, like microwaves; instead, a simple metal dish will suffice.\n",
      "Microwaves are of immense interest to astronomers.\n",
      "Cosmic background radiation – that amazing \"first light\" emitted when the Universe was only a few hundred thousand years old – exists mainly in the form of microwaves.\n",
      "Radio waves, which have even longer and less energetic wavelengths than microwaves, are typically collected using large metal dishes.\n",
      "Radio waves are produced by supernova remnants and by electrons passing through the magnetic fields of distant radio galaxies.\n",
      "For light with wavelengths that are shorter than those of visible light, like ultraviolet rays, it is possible to use optical telescopes.\n",
      "Unfortunately for astronomers (but fortunately for human beings), most ultraviolet light is absorbed by the ozone layer before reaching Earth’s surface.\n",
      "It is therefore necessary to use satellites for ultraviolet studies.\n",
      "Ultraviolet light is the most abundant type of energy generated by very hot stars.\n",
      "Satellites must also be used to study X-rays and gamma rays, which have wavelengths that are even shorter and more energetic than those of ultraviolet rays.\n",
      "These light rays are so energetic, however, that they can easily pass through mirrors; special collectors must be used to detect them.\n",
      "Most X-rays are emitted by pockets of hot gases found between galaxies and near black holes.\n",
      "Gamma rays are mainly found in the vicinity of supernova explosions.\n",
      "Astronomers « Return to the instruments Photographic plates Memorizing light In the early days of astronomy, astronomers had to draw their observations on paper.\n",
      "The method was, of course, imperfect and prone not only to errors in reproduction, but also to the unintentional omission of important details.\n",
      "The invention of photography, which could accurately transfer images to paper, was quickly adopted as a convenient solution.\n",
      "In fact, astronomers began using photography almost as soon as it was invented.\n",
      "The principle behind photography is the use of light-sensitive chemicals, like silver salts.\n",
      "These are dispersed in a gel to create a mixture known as emulsion.\n",
      "Once the emulsion is exposed to light, the light-sensitive chemicals react and become opaque to varying degrees depending on the amount of exposure.\n",
      "The result is a photographic image.\n",
      "It was in 1793 that the French inventor Joseph Nicéphore Niépce first began thinking of a method to record light.\n",
      "He started experimenting in 1814 and succeeded in setting images on paper in 1816.\n",
      "In 1822, he made the first permanent photo by using a sheet of polished tin coated with a petroleum derivative called bitumen of Judea (a type of tar).\n",
      "Unaware of the progress made by Niépce, the British scientist William Henry Fox Talbot began his own set of experiments in 1834 and recorded images on paper in 1835.\n",
      "His process became known in 1839 and he obtained a patent in 1841.\n",
      "The French inventor Hippolyte Bayard began his experiments before 1836, but it was only in 1839 that he is known, with certainty, to have successfully recorded an image.\n",
      "His process was publicized in 1840, and of all the other methods developed before 1841, it was Bayard’s that produced the best and most detailed images.\n",
      "In 1838, after continuing the work of his associate, Niépce, the French painter and inventor Louis Jacques Mandé Daguerre took an image of the Moon at the request of the French astronomer Dominique François Jean Arago.\n",
      "Daguerre’s technique, which used copper plates coated with silver, was made known to the public in 1839 and the images were called \"daguerreotypes\".\n",
      "It would become the most widely used method after 1840.\n",
      "The German astronomer Johann Heinrich von Mädler came up with term \"photography\" in 1839 by combining \"photo\" (from the Greek word for light) and \"graphy\" (to write).\n",
      "The word was quickly popularized by the British astronomer John Frederick William Herschel, who is often mistakenly given credit for inventing the word.\n",
      "In 1840, the American doctor and chemist John William Draper produced a daguerreotype of the Moon: the first astronomical photograph ever created in North America.\n",
      "The French optician Noël Marie Paymal Lerebours photographed the Sun for the first time in 1842, but no details were visible.\n",
      "In 1850, two Americans – astronomer William Cranch Bond and photographer John Adams Whipple – produced the first photograph of a star when they made a daguerreotype of Vega (also known as Alpha Lyrae).\n",
      "Also in 1850, the English inventor Frederick Scott Archer came up with the wet collodion process.\n",
      "Collodion is a viscous (thick) liquid that Archer used to coat glass plates.\n",
      "By producing a photographic negative on glass rather than on paper, the resulting images were much sharper and could be made much larger, hence the great interest for astronomers.\n",
      "Archer published his technique in 1851 and astronomers rapidly adopted the use of photographic plates.\n",
      "In 1857, using this method, George Phillips Bond of the United States was the first to photograph a double star (Mizar and Alcor).\n",
      "In 1879, the American inventor George Eastman (who would go on to found the Eastman-Kodak company in 1892) built a machine for coating photographic plates with emulsion that allowed photographs to be produced in great quantity.\n",
      "During the first few decades of the 1900’s, the Eastman Company worked in collaboration with several astronomical observatories to develop emulsions that were increasingly sensitive to light.\n",
      "The photographic plate thus became the imaging medium par excellence in the 20th century.\n",
      "Astrophotography experienced its golden age between the 1960’s and 1980.\n",
      "Thanks to colour filters, images produced from photographic plates could also be presented in colours, which greatly increased the public’s interest in astronomy.\n",
      "Astronomers « Return to the instruments Filters Blocking some light to reveal more details In 1861, the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell created the first colour photograph.\n",
      "He made the photo by first placing a black and white photographic plate behind a plate of red glass.\n",
      "He then repeated the procedure with a green plate, and then blue.\n",
      "He projected the three \"negatives\" on a screen using glass plates in the corresponding colours and thus obtained a colour image.\n",
      "Today, we call Maxwell’s red, green and blue glass plates \"filters\".\n",
      "A filter allows some colours to be blocked, which emphasizes the remaining colours that pass through.\n",
      "By carefully choosing filters, it is possible to reveal details that would otherwise be difficult to see.\n",
      "In 1878, Frederick Charles Luther Wratten of England founded one of the first companies to supply photographic material.\n",
      "In 1909, he developed a system of number-coded colour filters that quickly became the standard in the photography industry.\n",
      "The Eastman-Kodak Company bought Wratten’s company in 1912 and continued to use his filter system.\n",
      "After acquiring Wratten’s company, Eastman-Kodak began to manufacture filters specifically designed for astronomy work.\n",
      "The company continues to make them today and, surprisingly, still uses Wratten’s original numbering system.\n",
      "The market is shared by other companies – like Lumicon, Meade and Orion – who also design filters for professional and amateur astronomers.\n",

      "Astronomers « Return to the instruments Photometers Measuring the brightness of celestial objects A photometer is an instrument that measures and quantifies the brightness of a celestial body (a galaxy, star, comet or planet, for example).\n",
      "The brightness depends on the luminosity of the object and on the distance that separates the object from the photometer, as well as the amount of matter between the two that can obscure the object.\n",
      "A very luminous star could appear dim if it is far enough away or is partly obscured by gaseous clouds and interstellar dust.\n",
      "A photometer has several applications in astronomy.\n",
      "In the case of a star, for example, a photometer can be used to determine its temperature, its distance and even its age.\n",
      "Photometers can also be used to determine if planets are orbiting about certain stars.\n",
      "Let’s take a look at the case of temperature.\n",
      "A hot star will emit a lot of light in the blue portion of the spectrum (relatively energetic wavelengths), whereas a cold star will mainly emit red light (less energetic wavelengths).\n",
      "By using a photometer to measure the amount of light emitted at blue and red wavelengths (that is, the \"colour\" of the star), temperature can be estimated.\n",
      "The brightness of a celestial object is a measure of its luminous flux: the amount of incoming light.\n",
      "The luminous flux of a star is dependent on a combination of temperature, the size of its surface, and its distance from Earth.\n",
      "If we know its temperature (by its colour) and its distance (by other methods), we can calculate its surface area and thus its size.\n",
      "Astronomers can use photometers to precisely measure the amount of light emitted at specific wavelengths that correspond to the emission lines produced by heated chemical elements.\n",
      "This information is used to establish the chemical composition of a star.\n",
      "Many different methods have been developed for estimating the brightness of celestial bodies.\n",
      "All the initial attempts, however, had a major drawback: the estimate had to be made visually and could vary greatly from one observer to another.\n",
      "In 1836, the British astronomer John Frederick William Herschel changed all that.\n",
      "Herschel invented a photometer (\"astrometer\" as he called it) that allowed the observer to visually compare the brightness of stars using a scale based on the reduced telescopic image of the Moon.\n",
      "It was the first true photometer.\n",
      "In 1839, the French astronomer Dominique François Jean Arago proposed the design of a new photometer using photographic principles.\n",
      "His goal was to eliminate the role played by the observer in determining the brightness of an object by rendering the technique completely objective.\n",
      "In 1844, the French physicists Jean Bernard Léon Foucault and Armand Hippolyte Louis Fizeau conducted a series of experiments for Arago in which a photometer was coupled with a daguerreotype.\n",
      "It took until 1885 for photographic plates to be systematically used in photometry.\n",
      "It was in that year that the Dutch astronomer Jacobus Cornelius Kapteyn began to measure the brightness of 454,875 stars from the Southern Hemisphere.\n",
      "The technique typically used at the time to determine an object’s brightness consisted of measuring its diameter on a photographic plate.\n",
      "The more intense the brightness, the more the plate would react and the greater the diameter of the image.\n",
      "The problem with this method is that if the light is too intense, the emulsion becomes saturated and stops reacting.\n",
      "In 1910, the American astronomer Charles Edward Pickering found a solution to the problem of saturation: he proposed to measure the amount of light passing through the object’s image on the plate, rather than its diameter.\n",
      "Many improvements have been made to photographic photometers during the 20th century.\n",
      "Some of the most notable include the addition of an adjustable iris around a star’s image (1934), the complete automation of the procedure (1969), and the addition of a laser to increase the precision of the data (1971).\n",

      "Using a thermometer, he measured the temperature of each of the coloured rays and determined that the temperature increased from blue to red.\n",
      "Pushing his experiment a little bit further, Herschel placed the thermometer beyond the red light rays where no light was visible.\n",
      "To his great surprise, he measured a temperature even higher than that within any of the visible rays.\n",
      "He proved, for the first time ever, that invisible light – the infrared – exists beyond the red portion of the light spectrum.\n",
      "In 1856, the Scottish astronomer Charles Piazzi Smyth detected infrared light emanating from the Moon.\n",
      "He conducted his observations at different elevations and realized that the best data had been collected at the highest elevations.\n",
      "He was thus the first to understand that the terrestrial atmosphere absorbs some part of the infrared light coming from space.\n",
      "Unfortunately, the composition of the collodion was not revealed and, for the next twenty years, all attempts to produce another infrared photograph failed.\n",
      "The first publicly known infrared-sensitive chemical compound, dicyanine, was discovered in 1903.\n",

      "Each pixel is separated from the next by thin insulators.\n",
      "To take a photo, the CCD is exposed to light: the same principle as taking a photo using a photographic film or plate.\n",
      "When light strikes a pixel, however, the silicon produces an electric charge, and the greater the amount of light, the greater the charge.\n",
      "When the exposure is finished, the camera’s microprocessor reads the charge on the pixels, row by row, and transforms the information into a digital image.\n",
      "Exposing a CCD for two minutes can therefore reveal more details than is possible during a one-hour exposure using a conventional photographic plate.\n",
      "Other than photography, CCDs are used in photocopiers, facsimile (fax) machines, scanners and barcode readers.\n",

      "Without knowing it, he had discovered polarization – a very important property of light.\n",
      "Unfortunately, without the benefit of a theory that could adequately explain the nature and behaviour of light, Bartholin was unable to deduce the origins of the phenomenon.\n",
      "In 1678, the Danish physicist and astronomer Christiaan Huygens also observed the splitting of light by Icelandic spar calcite.\n",
      "He presented an explanation in 1690 that was based on the presence of \"ether\" – a hypothetical substance that filled space – but it was quickly disputed.\n",
      "Using this theory, physicists quickly understood that when a natural light source emits light, it generates a myriad of waves that oscillate in planes oriented in many different directions (see illustration).\n",
      "Consequently, if we project light onto a screen pierced with numerous parallel slits, only the light waves with the same orientation as the slits will be able to pass through.\n",
      "Only two years later, in 1811, the French astronomer Dominique François Jean Arago invented the polariscope, an instrument that can determine whether or not light is polarized.\n",

      "This is destructive interference.\n",
      "Between these two extremes lie an infinite number of variations in which crests and troughs combine together to intensify or dim the light.\n",

      "The Earth’s atmosphere consists of layers of air at different temperatures that interact and cause large-scale movements of air masses (referred to as turbulence by scientists).\n",
      "For astronomers, turbulence is detrimental to their work as it disrupts the trajectory of light rays.\n",
      "This causes stars in the sky to twinkle and telescope images to be distorted.\n",
      "A simple means to minimize the effects of this inconvenient phenomenon is to build astronomical observatories at high elevations so that the telescopes only peer through the upper levels of the terrestrial atmosphere.\n",
      "The first research into resolving the problem of image distortion related to atmospheric turbulence was conducted in 1902 by the German physician Karl Strehl, who proposed a method of evaluating the image quality produced by optical systems.\n",
      "In 1941, the Soviet mathematician Andrei Nikolaevich Kolmogorov made several breakthroughs into the study of turbulence.\n",
      "His work would later be integrated into atmospheric models used to correct distortions affecting astronomical images.\n",
      "In 1953, the American astronomer Horace Welcome Babcock invented adaptive optics, a process that corrects image distortions caused by the terrestrial atmosphere.\n",
      "The technique consists of taking a sample of the light received by the telescope and calculating its degree of distortion.\n",
      "Deformable mirrors are then used to redirect the light rays and produce a corrected image.\n",
      "The proposal was promising, but Babcock was not able to construct his system for technical reasons.\n",
      "In 1957, the American physician Robert B. Leighton of the California Institute of Technology succeeded in reducing atmosphere-induced image distortions using the 1.5-metre telescope at the Mount Wilson Observatory in California.\n",
      "His technique consisted of inclining the telescope’s secondary mirror several times per second.\n",
      "In so doing, he managed to obtain the best images ever recorded of Jupiter and Saturn.\n",
      "In that same year, the Soviet physicist Vladimir Pavlovich Linnik published an article in which he proposed that an artificial \"guide star\" could be created by pointing a laser at the sky and targeting its focal point in the upper atmosphere to agitate gas molecules.\n",
      "If an adaptive optics system uses a natural \"guide star\", it must be bright enough compared to the celestial object of interest to provide adequate light for the telescope’s detector.\n",
      "The guide star and the study object must also appear sufficiently close in the sky.\n",
      "It is not always easy to find a star that fulfills these criteria, hence the idea of creating an artificial guide star.\n",
      "In 1970, the American engineer W. Thomas Cathey and his collaborators were the first to experimentally demonstrate an adaptive optics system that operated in real time.\n",
      "Three years later, in 1973, another American engineer, John W. Hardy, built the first adaptive optics system intended for astronomy.\n",
      "Originally designed to detect Soviet military satellites, the system used a deformable mirror.\n",
      "Astronomers took advantage of the technique and new adaptive optics systems began to appear.\n",
      "In 1977, the American physicist Andrew Buffington developed the first system to use a segmented mirror.\n",
      "Each of the six segments is controlled by a piston that could adjust the inclination.\n",
      "In 1981, the American physicist Robert Q. Fugate and his team began to work on a system that would use a laser to generate a guide star – the idea originally proposed by Linnik in 1957.\n",
      "The first tests were performed in 1983 and 1984.\n",
      "Since then, several adaptive optics systems have been equipped with a laser that operates on this principle.\n",
      "In 1991, the American army been declassifying their confidential work on adaptive optics.\n",
      "Upon accessing the documents, the astronomy community realized that they had already designed and constructed more powerful and less costly systems than those of the military.\n",
      "As of 2005, 18 observatories and 26 large telescopes are equipped with image correction systems.\n",

      "What would we do without it?\n",
      "Since we first opened our eyes, humans have worshipped the Sun as a god of light and a source of life and security.\n",
      "The emergence of rational thought brought with it a need to question the nature of this phenomenon.\n",
      "So what exactly is light?\n",
      "Light is a form of energy produced by matter.\n",
      "To understand how light is created, we must first take a look at atoms, the building blocks of matter.\n",
      "In the world of atomic particles, the adage holds true that opposites attract and thus the nucleus and electrons are mutually attracted to each other within the atom.\n",
      "Although an electron cannot randomly occupy positions within an atom, it can nonetheless change its distance from the nucleus by changing its energy level.\n",
      "To do this, its energy content must be modified to match the energy level of the new orbit that it will enter.\n",
      "For example, to move from a distant orbit into a closer orbit, the electron must eliminate some of its energy.\n",
      "The energy released is partly electrical in nature and – as with all negatively charged bodies – partly magnetic.\n",
      "This excess energy is released by the electron in the form of an energy packet known as a \"photon\".\n",
      "A photon is an energy particle that has no mass and moves at high speed.\n",
      "When a moving photon interacts with matter, it does so as a wave, like a wave moving across the surface of water.\n",
      "These waves are known as \"electromagnetic waves\" because they display both electrical and magnetic components.\n",

      "Astronomers White light: a mix of colours In 1665, Francesco Maria Grimaldi, an Italian Jesuit priest, conducted a simple experiment the results of which went on to occupy the minds of several generations of physicists, including Newton and Einstein.\n",
      "To his great surprise, Grimaldi found that the beam of light illuminating the screen was larger than expected.\n",
      "Strangest of all, however, was that the light was no longer white, but became two or three rays of different colours.\n",
      "Without knowing it, Grimaldi had conducted the first experiment into the splitting of light.\n",
      "He assigned the term \"diffraction\" to the phenomenon, a term that survives to this day.\n",
      "Grimaldi later realized that diffraction is a phenomenon that does not only occur when light is projected through a slit; instead, it occurs each time light strikes the edges of any object.\n",
      "Several scientists were interested in the effect but none could explain it.\n",
      "The answer was not long in coming, however, and it was Isaac Newton himself who would provide the explanation.\n",
      "In 1662, Newton began his own optical experiments.\n",
      "One of his first projects was to construct a refracting telescope.\n",
      "He polished lenses and attempted to improve the instrument by getting rid of the coloured fringes that would appear on the margins of his images (he did not succeed and decided instead to develop a mirror-based reflecting telescope).\n",
      "In 1666, during one of his optical experiments, Newton passed sunlight through a prism and split the light beam into different colours, like what he observed along the edges of his optical lenses.\n",
      "Others before him had conducted similar experiments, but Newton was the first to understand that white light consists of a mix of light rays, each with a different colour.\n",
      "Newton also understood that white light can be separated into its components because each ray of colour is deviated by the glass of the prism by a different amount.\n",
      "He realized, for example, that red light is consistently less deviated than violet light.\n",
      "This ordered separation of coloured rays is known as the \"spectrum\".\n",
      "The spectrum of white light consists of six basic colours arranged in a specific order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet.\n",
      "Although Newton understood that a beam of light of a particular colour is always deviated by the same amount, he did not appear to understand why this is so.\n",
      "More than a century would pass before another British scientist by the name of Thomas Young would provide part of the answer.\n",

      "Astronomers …or the birth of spectroscopy In 1801, the physicist Thomas Young clearly demonstrated that light travels as a wave, much like the succession of crests and troughs along the surface of water.\n",
      "One of Young’s most astonishing feats was that he succeeded in measuring the wavelengths of red and violet light; that is, the distance between two crests or troughs of successive waves.\n",
      "His results revealed a wavelength of 7 thousandths of a millimetre for red light and 4 thousandths of a millimetre for violet.\n",
      "Combining these measurements with the basic concepts of Newton’s work, he concluded that light with a longer wavelength is less deflected than light with a shorter wavelength.\n",
      "During the same historic period, around 1802, the British chemist William Hyde Wollaston uncovered a surprising fact: the spectrum of sunlight is not continuous.\n",
      "In fact, numerous black lines are superimposed on the colours of its spectrum.\n",
      "Unfortunately, this revelation did not attract much attention and no ideas were advanced to explain their presence.\n",
      "Several years later, in 1814, the German optician Josef von Fraunhofer noticed the same black lines in the spectrum of sunlight.\n",
      "Although he did not understand their significance, he nonetheless measured their positions and catalogued a total of 324.\n",
      "In 1859, the German chemist Robert Wilhelm Bunsen (who improved and popularized the burner that bears his name) devised an original analytical technique: he inserted mineral salts into the flame of his burner and observed the colours produced by the gas emitted.\n",
      "He was thus able to determine whether a particular substance was present in a mineral by observing a colour that, according to him, characterized that substance.\n",
      "Gustav Robert Kirchhoff, a German physician and friend of Bunsen, proposed the additional step of dispersing the light emitted by the gas by using a prism.\n",
      "The two researchers thus made a major discovery: each chemical element generates a series of spectral rays that uniquely characterize the substance, much like a fingerprint identifies a person.\n",
      "The invention of tTheir new analytical technique, spectroscopy, led to the discovery of many new chemical elements in the years ahead.\n",
      "Kirchhoff was interested in the spectrum of sunlight and realized that Fraunhofer’s black lines corresponded exactly to the bright rays emitted by specific chemical elements.\n",
      "He deduced that the white light produced by the hot surface of the Sun was in part absorbed by certain chemical elements present in its cooler atmosphere, which produces black lines in the spectrum.\n",
      "Kirchhoff’s discoveries opened the doors to spectroscopic studies in astronomy.\n",
      "To their great satisfaction, astronomers were now equipped with a method for determining the chemical composition of stars and nebulas, and even their temperature, distance, speed and age by measuring the intensity of the different spectral rays and applying basic principles of physics.\n",
      "It was through spectroscopy that light allowed us to \"touch the stars\", something long believed impossible due to the great distances involved.\n",
      "One problem remained unanswered for Kirchhoff: he could not explain how matter could emit or absorb light.\n",
      "Other researchers would help resolve this enigma 50 years later.\n",
      "Astronomers A map of visible and invisible light Our understanding of the nature of light took a giant leap forward in the second half of the 1800’s with the help of the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell.\n",
      "Maxwell was interested in a multitude of scientific problems that included electricity and magnetism.\n",
      "He first published articles on these subjects in 1855, then compiled his work in 1873 into a book entitled Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, which is now considered a classic in the field of matter.\n",
      "In 1863, Maxwell discovered that by manipulating equations for electricity and magnetism, it was possible to extract a value that corresponded to the speed of light.\n",
      "Surprised by this result, he began to suspect that light, electricity and magnetism were one and the same.\n",
      "To follow up on this idea, he developed new equations for electricity and magnetism and concluded that not only is light a wave – as demonstrated by Thomas Young more than 50 years earlier – but an electromagnetic wave.\n",
      "The discovery that light possesses both electric and magnetic components proved to be of paramount importance.\n",
      "Maxwell went on to reason that invisible electromagnetic waves exist beyond the visible and ultraviolet light spectra, but sadly he did not live long enough to test his idea.\n",
      "Hertz labelled these new waves \"radio waves\", and their discovery was put to beneficial use in the development of the telegraph and the radio.\n",
      "Today, the electromagnetic spectrum is known to extend far beyond the colours of the rainbow, as shown in the diagram below.\n",
      "The portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that we can see with our eyes is tiny with respect to its full extent.\n",
      "If the electromagnetic spectrum was a window 30 million kilometres long, we would only have to open it three centimetres to let in all the visible light.\n",
      "The electromagnetic spectrum is continuous but scientists have divided it in an artificial manner for practical reasons.\n",
      "The divisions were mainly established by the limitations of the various techniques used to detect wavelengths.\n",
      "For example, the limits of the visible light range is defined by what our eyes can detect.\n",
      "Although other electromagnetic waves – radio waves, infrared light, ultraviolet light, X-rays and gamma rays – represent \"colours\" that are invisible to us, they are nonetheless forms of light.\n",

      "Despite this lack of understanding, they nonetheless knew how to separate the light emitted by a gas into a spectrum that was diagnostic of the chemical elements contained in the gas.\n",
      "In 1859, the German physicist Gustav Robert Kirchhoff called this type of spectrum an \"emission spectrum\".\n",
      "Many researchers attempted to explain how matter could generate an emission spectrum but without success.\n",
      "It was only in 1900 that the German physicist Max Planck would provide part of the answer.\n",
      "Planck noted that it was impossible to solve the problem using existing principles of physics and proceeded to develop a revolutionary theory that marked nothing less than the beginning of modern physics.\n",
      "In his theory, Planck maintained that light could only be emitted as small packets of energy that he named \"quanta\" (later known as \"photons\").\n",
      "This proposal ran contrary to all contemporary knowledge about light at that time.\n",
      "In fact, light was considered to be a continuous form of energy that propagated as an electromagnetic wave and not – as Planck proposed – as a form of discontinous energy in the form of particles, like photons.\n",
      "The debate finally came to a head – and to a resolution – when the German physicist Albert Einstein entered the scene in 1905.\n",
      "Einstein not only supported Planck’s idea, he went one step further: he proposed that light behaved as a particle (a photon) but also retained its wave character and must therefore be considered as both a particle and a wave.\n",
      "Furthermore, Einstein established that the energy of a photon is related to the wavelength of the radiation.\n",
      "He concluded that waves with long wavelengths, like red light, transport small amounts of energy, whereas those with short wavelengths, like violet light, transport more energy.\n",
      "In 1913, the Danish physicist Niels Henrik David Bohr integrated the advances of Planck and Einstein into his new model of the atom to explain how matter could emit light in the form of particles.\n",
      "According to Bohr, the atom consists of negatively charged electrons that orbit around a positively charged nucleus.\n",
      "The model further specified that electrons orbit the nucleus at well defined distances from the nucleus.\n",
      "An electron orbiting near the nucleus has relatively little energy because it is held in its orbital by the strong attractive force exerted by the nucleus.\n",
      "Energy must be added to this electron for it to \"jump\" to a higher orbital, and the further away it jumps, the more energy it would need.\n",
      "An electron in a starting position that is farther from the nucleus already has more energy because it must compensate for the great distance that separates it from the nucleus.\n",
      "Less energy would thus be needed to make this electron jump to a higher level compared to an electron that started closer to the nucleus.\n",
      "According to Bohr, when a material is heated, some of the electrons in orbitals near the nucleus will absorb enough energy to allow them to jump to new orbital levels at great distance from the nucleus.\n",
      "The electrons, however, will eventually return to their original orbitals; when they do so, they must release enough energy so that their energy content again matches the energy level of the original orbital.\n",
      "Given the basic principle that the atomic nucleus of each chemical element has a positive charge different from that of any other element, its electron orbitals must also have distinctive energy contents since the electrons must balance the charge of the nucleus.\n",
      "The energy given off by an electron when dropping from a distant orbital to a closer orbital will thus be a photon with a characterisitc amount of energy and a corresponding wavelength in the emission spectrum.\n",
      "If the atoms of a given element have a combination of possible orbital jumps that is different from the combinations possible for the atoms of other elements, then every element will display its own unique emission spectrum.\n",
      "The following diagram shows the emission spectra for various elements.\n",
      "Notice how the emission lines are diagnostic, much like a bar code or a fingerprint.\n",

      "Emission spectra of iron.\n",
      "In astronomy, this phenomenon is often observed when white light, no matter what its source (the surface of the Sun or another star, for example) passes through a thin cloud of gas or dust.\n",
      "In this case, instead of seeing a continuous spectrum from red to violet, astronomers will observe a spectrum in which several rays of colour are missing and dark lines take their place.\n",
      "It was around 1802 that the British chemist William Hyde Wollaston noticed for the first time that the spectrum from the Sun displays just this type of effect.\n",
      "The solar spectrum is discontinuous with numerous dark lines occuring among the coloured bands.\n",
      "At the time, Wollaston did not understand why this is so.\n",
      "In 1814, the German optician Josef von Fraunhofer also noticed these same dark lines in the spectrum of sunlight.\n",
      "Although he also failed to understand their significance, he nonetheless measured and documented the positions of 324 lines.\n",
      "It was only in 1859 that the German physicist Gustav Robert Kirchhoff understood that Fraunhofer’s dark lines corresponded exactly to the bright lines emitted by certain known elements.\n",
      "According to him, the dark lines represented specific chemical elements that are present within the Sun’s atmosphere but are absorbing certain spectral rays emitted by the Sun’s surface.\n",
      "Kirchhoff named this type of spectrum an \"absorption spectrum\".\n",
      "Unfortunately, he did not understand at the time how matter could absorb spectral rays.\n",
      "In 1860, the Italian astronomer Giovanni Battista Donati had the idea of attaching a spectroscope to his telescope.\n",
      "He studied the spectrum of fifteen or so stars and published his results in 1863.\n",
      "He was followed in 1862 by the amateur British astronomer William Huggins, the American astronomer Lewis Morris Rutherfurd, and the Italian astronomer Angelo Secchi, all of whom independantly worked on the Sun, the planets, the Moon and the stars.\n",
      "These researchers began a scientific revolution by being the first to extract information from the light emitted by stars.\n",
      "They were quickly followed by other astronomers, and the study of emission spectra became the main field of study in astronomy.\n",
      "Despite considerable progress, the explanation of how light could be absorbed by matter still eluded the scientists of the time.\n",
      "The Danish physicist Niels Henrik David Bohr finally provided the answer in 1913.\n",
      "Bohr developed a new model of the atom consisting of negatively charged electrons that occupy specific orbitals around a positive nucleus.\n",
      "According to Bohr, the farther the electron orbital is positioned from the nucleus, the higher its energy content in order to compensate for the great distance to the nucleus and its attractive force.\n",
      "When a cool material is heated, some of the electrons will jump from low energy orbitals near the nucleus to more distant and higher energy orbitals.\n",
      "To do this, each electron must increase its energy content to exactly match the energy level of the new orbital it will occupy.\n",
      "Bohr proposed that electrons absorb this extra energy in the form of \"energy packets\" as described by Planck and Einstein.\n",
      "The same type of phenomenon occurs in space when the light emitted from the surface of a star (like the Sun) shines through the cooler gases in the atmosphere surrounding it.\n",
      "The atmosphere absorbs part of the white light emitted from the star, which produces a colour spectrum marked by dark lines (absorption lines) that are characteristic of the elements present in the gas.\n",
      "The study of a star’s spectrum thus gives us information about the chemical composition of its atmosphere.\n",
      "Astronomers The astronomer’s unit for measuring distance In astronomy, distances between celestial objects – like stars and galaxies – are very large.\n",
      "For example, the distance that separates us from out closest neighbour, the Moon, is on average 385,000 kilometres.\n",
      "The Sun, on the otherhand, is on average 150 million kilometres away, and the next closest star is Proxima Centauri at 40,000 billion kilometres.\n",
      "To avoid manipulating such long numbers on a regular basis, a unit of distance better adapted to the scale of the Universe quickly became a necessity.\n",
      "One unit of distance commonly used in astronomy is the light-year.\n",
      "A light-year is the distance travelled by light in one year, which is 9 trillion, 460 billion, 730 million, 472 thousand and 581 kilometres.\n",
      "It was first necessary to determine the speed of light in order to know the distance that it will travel in one year.\n",
      "Before 1676, most scientists thought that light moved instantaneously from one point to another.\n",
      "In that year, however, the Danish physicist Ole Christensen Rømer was the first to demonstrate that light had a finite speed.\n",
      "In 1671, Rømer began to observe the satellites of Jupiter and decided to measure the time it took for one of the moons (particularly Io) to disappear behind the giant planet and reappear on the other side.\n",
      "By accumulating data for many years, he determined that the time separating the eclipses was shorter when the Earth was closer to Jupiter and longer when it was at a greater distance.\n",
      "In 1675, the French astronomer Jean-Dominique Cassini, for whom Rømer was an assistant, proposed that the difference was due to the time it took light to travel from Jupiter to Earth.\n",
      "However, he quickly changed his mind and abandoned the hypothesis.\n",
      "Rømer, on the other hand, continued to pursue the idea and estimated that light takes 22 minutes to travel a distance equal to the diameter of the Earth’s orbit (we know today that the true value is closer to 16 minutes and 40 seconds).\n",
      "If Rømer had calculated the speed of light using his data, he would have come up with an answer of 135,000 kilometres per second, which is about half the accepted value today of 299,792 kilometres per second.\n",
      "The main source of error would have been the diameter of Earth’s orbit, which was not well known at the time.\n",
      "It was only in 1729 that the majority of the astronomical community were finally convinced that light had finite speed.\n",
      "The British astronomer James Bradley published a study demonstrating that the annual variation observed in the position of the stars is related to the speed of light.\n",
      "He estimated that light travels at 301,000 kilometres per second, which is very close to the accepted value.\n",
      "In 1838, the German astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel (and not the Scottish astronomer Thomas Henderson, as is often mentioned) was the first to use the light-year as a unit of measurement in astronomy.\n",
      "He measured the distance separating us from the binary star 61 Cygni as 10.3 light-years.\n",
      "The advantage of the light-year as a unit of measurement is not only that it quantifies distance, but that it also provides the time it takes for light to reach Earth.\n",
      "For example, if 61 Cygni is 10.3 light-years from Earth (97,445,523,867,584 kilometres), then it takes it’s light 10.3 years to reach us.\n",
      "We are therefore always seeing 61 Cygni as it was more than 10 years ago.\n",
      "This is how light allows us to \"see into the past\" and why a telescope is really a type of \"time travel machine\".\n",
      "This concept applies equally to very distant galaxies that are measured at distances of 10 to 12 billion light-years: they appear to us now the way they existed 10 to 12 billion years ago, only a short time after the Big Bang.\n",

      "Astronomers When stars disappear… One of the negative effects of industrialization on human activity and the environment is the production of excessive light.\n",
      "It may seem strange, but excess light is a form of pollution, particularly at night.\n",
      "The negative effects of light pollution impact many fields of study, including economics, ecology and, of course, astronomy.\n",
      "Most people do not consider the surplus of artificial light as a form of pollution because it is not permanent; all we must do is collectively turn out our lights to make it disappear.\n",
      "In reality, however, such a solution is unrealistic because our society needs artificial light to function.\n",
      "Light pollution is mainly caused by lighting systems that are misdirected, excessive, inefficient or unnecessary.\n",
      "Most light pollution is found in urban settings where artificial light sources are numerous.\n",
      "In these areas, light sources may be partly directed towards the sky, or downward directed light may be reflected upward.\n",
      "Light is then dispersed by layers in the atmosphere and produces a glow that diminishes the darkness of the night sky.\n",
      "In large Canadian cities, more than 95% of stars that can normally be seen with the naked eye are no longer visible.\n",
      "Unexpected negative effects From bacteria to the stars The negative effects of light pollution on human activity are numerous.\n",
      "From an economic point of view, for example, the use of excessive lighting or unnecessary lighting constitutes a waste of energy that is costly to both the individual and to industries.\n",
      "In Quebec, the cost of \"lighting the sky\" is estimated at 45 million dollars per year.\n",
      "On a larger scale, excessive lighting can have an impact on global climate change if the required electricity was generated by burning fossil fuels.\n",
      "Wildlife and plants are also affected.\n",
      "For example, nighttime lighting can confuse animals that migrate (like moths and migratory birds), can modify predator-prey relationships, and can even alter competitiveness within the same species.\n",
      "In the case of moths, for example, it was discovered that numerous flowering plants declined in numbers when the flight paths of pollinating moth species were affected by light pollution.\n",
      "It is even possible for entire ecosystems to be affected.\n",
      "In lakes, for example, zooplankton may stop feeding on algae if nighttime lighting is too strong.\n",
      "This leads to oxygen depletion in the lake, and many species of invertebrates and fish then die by asphyxiation.\n",
      "In astronomy, light pollution is a real and pressing problem.\n",
      "It diminishes the contrast between the dark sky and celestial sources of light, which makes it harder to see the stars.\n",
      "For the amateur astronomer, it is a major problem because access to a truly dark sky is increasingly difficult to find.\n",
      "The increasing inaccessibility of the starry sky is unfortunate because it has become evident that amateur astronomy plays an important role in the development of scientific interest among young people.\n",
      "In 2003, the British government even acknowledged the link between a reduced interest in the sciences and an increase in light pollution!\n",
      "For professional astronomers, artificial light is undesirable because it interferes with the collection of data.\n",
      "This is why new observatories are built in isolated regions.\n",
      "A number of amateur astronomy associations are also involved in protecting our endangered legacy, the starry night sky.\n",
      "The focus of light pollution abatement programs is to change the habits of the general population, companies and urban planners so that less artificial light will be wasted or misdirected.\n",
      "The plans typically revolve around three lines of action.\n",
      "The first consists of using lighting equipment that properly directs light where it is required, and not to the sides or towards the sky.\n",

      "Many of the peoples believed that everything found in nature was a living entity, even celestial objects like the Moon, the Sun and the stars.\n",
      "In the Amerindian belief system, the Earth is flat and the celestial objects revolve around it.\n",
      "The planets in the solar system are not thought of as planets, but rather as large stars that are simply brighter than the rest.\n",

      "For the majority of Amerindian societies, each star is a spirit – a powerful and sacred being.\n",
      "The Iroquois even oriented their long houses according to the four cardinal directions so that the Sun would shine onto the entrance at dawn, and set in the direction of the exit.\n",
      "The Amerindians grouped many of the stars into constellations, and most of these are associated with stories that serve as a lesson to youngsters.\n",
      "Some of the constellations, like Pleiades or the Great Bear, were also used to mark the seasons.\n",

      "The young man replied, \"I am Morning Star.\n",
      "You wanted me as your husband, so here I am.\"\n",
      "He placed a feather in her hair and asked her to close her eyes.\n",
      "He flew her up to the sky, into Sky Country.\n",
      "\"You may use this tool to harvest vegetables in our garden, but you must never touch the sacred turnip.\n",
      "If you do, it will bring misfortune.\"\n",
      "Time passed by and the woman gave birth to a baby.\n",
      "To her surprise, she found that she could see her tribe and old home through the hole left by the turnip.\n",

      "Unfortunately, what should not have happened did, and the child was forced to return to the Sky Country.\n",
      "But as he tried to pass through the hole left by the sacred turnip, the child became stuck.\n",
      "And that is why, to this day, there is a star that does not move across the sky.\n",
      "In some cases, the same celestial constellation is the subject of legends in more than one Amerindian society.\n",
      "For example, two tribes in Canada have stories about the constellation Pleiades.\n",
      "This one is from the Iroquois of Ontario.\n",
      "Many years ago, an Iroquois tribe began the trek toward their winter hunting grounds near a large lake in southeastern Canada.\n",
      "Upon their arrival, tribe members hurried to set up camp and tackle their chores.\n",
      "Eight children, tired of helping their parents, would gather together each day away from the tribe to dance for several hours.\n",
      "He was covered from head to toe with a coat of shiny white feathers and said to them, \"If you do not stop, misfortune will come your way.\"\n",
      "The children did not listen and continued to take longer and longer breaks during which they never stopped dancing.\n",
      "Day after day, the old man came to warn them until one evening, the children suddenly found themselves rising up into the air.\n",
      "The old man shook his head and thought, \"If only they would have listened to me.\"\n",
      "Not long after, the people of the village saw the children floating high in the sky.\n",
      "One of the children recognized his Father’s voice and stopped dancing, but quickly fell like a shooting star to the ground.\n",
      "Seven brothers living alone in the Northern Plains passed their time looking for their parents.\n",

      "Astronomers The Amerindians The Inuit The Inuit Their knowledge of the stars helped them navigate in a hostile environment where reference points are few and far between The Inuit peoples living in the Canadian Far North can view the dark night sky continuously for long periods of time.\n",
      "At the North Pole, for example, the Sun rises and sets only once each year.\n",
      "Contrary to popular belief, however, the polar night does not last for six months each year; instead, it lasts for four and a half months.\n",
      "The difference is due to the tilt of the Earth, which causes dawn and twilight to last for several weeks at the poles, thus shortening the duration of the true polar night by six weeks each year.\n",
      "Nonetheless, four and a half months is still a remarkably long night, and one might think that the peoples of the Arctic would have built up an extensive astronomical knowledge base.\n",
      "This, however, does not appear to have been the case.\n",
      "The time during which the northern peoples have access to the starry night sky is actually much shorter than four and a half months, even for the Inuit who live closest to the North Pole.\n",
      "Clouds and aurora borealis also mask the stars.\n",
      "Finally, the intense nighttime cold makes observation physically difficult.\n",
      "As such, the Inuit have only two and a half months per year to observe the starry sky if we take into account the presence of the Moon, and only two months per year if we take into account the other factors.\n",
      "All in all, the peoples of the North have difficult conditions to deal with and only a short period of time for studying the stars.\n",
      "The ancient Inuit believed the Earth (Nunarjuaq in the Inuktitut language) to be a flat and stationary body around which celestial objects revolved.\n",
      "It occupied the centre of their universe.\n",
      "The Moon (Taqqiq) was seen as a flat disk of ice, and the Sun (Siqniq) as a ball of fire.\n",
      "The disappearance of the Sun below the horizon for several months was taken as a sign that the cold and frost of winter had weighed it down so much that it could no longer lift itself into the sky.\n",
      "The planets of the solar system were seen as large stars, and the distant stars as holes in the celestial dome.\n",
      "Interestingly, the existence of the North Star – the polar star that remains in a fixed position in the sky and around which all the other stars appear to revolve – appears to have been unknown to the peoples of the North.\n",
      "Only 33 stars were familiar to the ancient Inuit and only six or seven of them were given names.\n",
      "Among them were several that were used for navigation during their travels.\n",
      "As for the other stars, they were grouped into 16 constellations, most of which were associated with myths in which humans and animals played central roles.\n",
      "Four men were hunting a bear.\n",
      "The bear escaped by climbing into the sky and the hunters decided to follow it.\n",
      "As they climbed higher and higher, one of the Inuit lost a mitten and decided to return to Earth to fetch it.\n",
      "The other hunters continued their hunt in the sky and we can still see them today climbing after the bear in single file.\n",
      "The Inuit measure the passage of time by using the arrival of the full moon, and their lunar calendar thus has 13 months.\n",
      "The year begins at different times for each Inuit society depending on their latitude, although the signal that marks the New Year is the same for each tribe: it is the moment when the Sun reappears above the horizon after the long polar night.\n",
      "This, of course, explains why the timing varies according the tribe’s northern location.\n",
      "One such story from the Inuit of the Canadian Central Arctic tells how light first appeared on Earth:\n",
      "In the beginning, darkness was everywhere.\n",
      "There was no light on Earth, and it was not possible to see the ground, the animals or humans.\n",
      "Strangely enough, however, an animal could transform into a human, and a human into an animal.\n",
      "There were several different animals, like bears, hares and foxes, but when these animals became human, they all became the same: they spoke the same language, lived in the same style of home, and hunted the same way.\n",
      "It was during this time that magic words were created.\n",
      "A word mentioned casually during a conversation could suddenly acquire magical powers, and nobody could explain how or why.\n",
      "One day, a fox and a hare were having an argument.\n",
      "The fox kept repeating \"Darkness!\" because he liked the way he could use the dark to steal the hunting catches of the humans.\n",
      "The hare, on the other hand, kept repeating \"Daylight!\" because he needed light to help him find food.\n",
      "Since then, night and day take turns shining over Earth, and the fox and the hare take turns finding food as well.\n",
      "For the Inuit, the Sun is generally seen as a woman, and the Moon as a man.\n",
      "A long time ago, after the World was created, a great shaman acquired such strong powers that he went to live in the sky.\n",
      "The brother and sister lived in harmony for a long time until a great disagreement arose between them and the brother hit the sister, marking her face with a disfiguring burn.\n",
      "The young woman left her brother to take refuge elsewhere in the sky where she became the Moon.\n",
      "Since then, the brother and his fire have followed her, trying to reach her, but never succeeding.\n",
      "The following is one example from the Inuit of Canada’s Eastern Arctic:\n",
      "A powerful angakoq (shaman) decided to visit the Moon.\n",
      "At his request, his hands were tied with a leather cord and the lamps in his home were extinguished.\n",
      "The shaman then prayed to his tormaq (spirit guide) to transport him to the Moon, and the spirit complied.\n",
      "Once he arrived, he realized that the Moon was a house.\n",
      "He entered and saw a beautiful woman, the Sun, to his left who asked him to put out the lamp in front of her.\n",
      "It is important that you do not laugh, or misfortune will come your way.\"\n",
      "The couple began to dance before the shaman.\n",
      "To his great surprise, he saw that the Sun-Woman had no back, no spine and no entrails; only a heart and lungs occupied her chest.\n",
      "The dance was very strange and the faces made by the couple so peculiar that the shaman ran away lest he should laugh.\n",
      "Soon after, the shaman decided to return to the house, determined not to laugh.\n",
      "Once the dance had ended, the Moon-Man graciously welcomed him and invited him to visit his home.\n",
      "In one room, the shaman saw large herds of deer that roamed over vast plains.\n",
      "In another room, he saw many pods of seals swimming in the ocean.\n",
      "The Moon-Man let the shaman choose one of each as a gift.\n",
      "The shaman told them his story of what he had seen on the Moon.\n",
      "The Moon-Man is often seen as a strong and fair spirit.\n",
      "This legend from the Inuit of Labrador is one such example:\n",
      "A young orphan lived with a family that treated him badly.\n",
      "He slept in the entrance tunnel with the dogs and ate only leftovers.\n",
      "Only the youngest of the Girls in the home treated him well.\n",
      "One night, while he lay on the ground staring up at the Moon, he thought of ways to escape.\n",
      "The more he stared at the Moon, the more convinced he became the he was staring at a human face.\n",
      "He was so certain the face was real that he pleaded to the Moon-Man to help him escape.\n",
      "The Moon-Man heard him and descended to Earth.\n",
      "He took the young orphan with him onto the beach where he flogged him with a whip.\n",
      "With each crack of the whip across his body, the boy became stronger and bigger.\n",
      "In the morning, the boy returned to the house and struck down all those who had been cruel to him, with the exception of the kind young Girl.\n",
      "She became his wife, and he became the leader of the village.\n",
      "After all, it is only natural for humans to wonder how far our planet lies from the Moon, the Sun and other celestial bodies.\n",
      "The ancients believed that this distance was not very far at all: they saw the stars as being fixed upon a nearby celestial dome.\n",
      "Over the course of time, however, astronomers began to realize that the size of the Universe is much greater than anyone had ever imagined.\n",
      "Today we know it is so big its limits remain unknown.\n",
      "In the 3rd century B.C., the Greek astronomer Aristarchus of Samos calculated the Earth–Moon and Earth–Sun distances using the angle between the Moon and the Sun at the first quarter moon.\n",
      "His method—based on imprecise data available at the time—estimated that the distance to the Sun is about 20 times the distance to the Moon.\n",
      "Although we now know that the Sun is really about 400 times the distance to the Moon, Aristarchus’ estimate was nonetheless revolutionary because it suggested that the Sun was much more distant than previously believed.\n",
      "Several decades later, another Greek astronomer, Hipparcus of Nicea, performed an amazing scientific feat by calculating the Earth–Moon distance with an error of less than 10%.\n",
      "He did this using the time it takes for the Moon to pass through the shadow of the Earth during a lunar eclipse, and by applying his own ingenious geometric calculations.\n",
      "Hipparcus also relied on the work of Eratosthenes of Cyrene who had fairly accurately estimated the diameter of the Earth to be 42,000 km (the real diameter is about 40,000 km).\n",
      "Even more precise parallax measurements would have to wait until the development and improvement of astronomical instruments.\n",
      "In fact, it was almost two millennia later in 1672 when Jean-Dominique Cassini, a French astronomer of Italian origin, and Jean Richer, a French astronomer, used more modern equipment to precisely measure the average Earth–Sun distance (also known as an \"astronomical unit\").\n",
      "Their method relied on simultaneous observations of Mars from Paris and French Guyana.\n",
      "The honour of being the first to measure the distance to a star other than the Sun must be given to the German astronomer Friedrich Bessel.\n",
      "In 1838, he calculated the distance to 61 Cygni as 11 light-years from Earth.\n",
      "These days, astronomers have several methods for measuring distances.\n",
      "For objects within the Milky Way, most methods employ the method of parallax.\n",
      "Another method for measuring galactic distances uses Type 1a supernovae: stars that generate constant amounts of energy after their supernova explosion.\n",
      "They can be thought of as a \"bomb standard\": an explosion of known strength and luminosity.\n",
      "Their apparent brightness in the sky is thus a measure of how far away they are from Earth.\n",
      "Although these types of methods for measuring astronomical distances have allowed scientists to estimate the extent of the Universe, the sheer scale of it is mind-boggling.\n",
      "It is somewhat easier to visualize such vast distances if we begin by imagining something smaller, like our own solar system.\n",
      "The solar system consists of the Sun, planets that revolve around the Sun, and millions of smaller bodies.\n",
      "The Oort Cloud, a vast reservoir of comets that circle the Sun, marks the outer limit of the solar system.\n",
      "The distance to this boundary is about 1.6 light-years (recall that each light-year is almost 10,000 billion kilometres).\n",
      "If you can imagine Pluto—the smallest and farthest of our solar system’s planets—as the same size as the head of a pin measuring 1 millimetre across, then the Sun would be as big as two 30-centimetre beach balls lying side by side 2.6 kilometres away from the head of the pin.\n",
      "Our solar system lies in the Milky Way spiral galaxy.\n",
      "At this scale, the size of our own solar system is quite insignificant.\n",
      "In fact, if our entire 1.6-light-year solar system could sit on the head of a pin, the rest of our galaxy would be the size of a hockey rink!\n",
      "The Milky Way is bunched together with more than 35 other galaxies to form a galaxy cluster known as the Local Group.\n",
      "The largest member, the Andromeda galaxy, is visible in a moonless night sky without light pollution.\n",
      "The other galaxies in the group, like the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Small Magellanic Cloud, are typically smaller than the Milky Way.\n",
      "The Local Group occupies an area with a diameter of about 10 million light-years and a centre lying somewhere between the Milky Way and Andromeda.\n",
      "If you can once again imagine the solar system as a head of a pin and our galaxy as a hockey rink, then the entire Local Group would measure 6.25 kilometres across.\n",
      "The giant Virgo galaxy cluster marks the centre of the Local Supercluster at a distance of 50 million light-years.\n",
      "The Virgo Cluster contains a \"cannibal\" galaxy at its centre—M87—that draws in and absorbs neighbouring galaxies.\n",
      "Galaxy superclusters appear to be grouped together along long filaments that stretch out for hundreds of millions of light-years.\n",
      "They are separated by immense voids that contain very few galaxies.\n",
      "The size of these virtually empty spaces is truly incredible—on the order of 100 million light-years.\n",
      "This grand-scale pattern defines the Universe across a distance of about 13 billion light-years.\n",
      "As much as we try, we cannot directly observe what lies beyond that distance.\n",
      "Astronomers Space Time The arrangement of matter Time The Universe existed in a highly compressed state more than 13 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since For a long time, scientists thought that the Universe was immutable—that it was unchanging over time and stars were the very essence of eternity.\n",
      "It was only during the 20th century that scientists realized that this belief is false, and that the cosmos changes even on human time scales.\n",
      "In other words, the Universe did not always display the same structure it does today.\n",
      "It evolved over time, and thus it has a history.\n",
      "This fascinating history began just over 13 billion years ago with a great explosion known as the Big Bang.\n",
      "The Big Bang theory was first presented in 1927 by the Belgian astronomer and priest George Henri Lemaître.\n",
      "Using Einstein’s theory of relativity combined with astronomical observations, Lemaître demonstrated that the Universe is expanding.\n",
      "Although the Big Bang theory was not well received by Einstein and his colleagues, it is now widely accepted in scientific circles.\n",
      "The turning point came in 1929 when American astronomer Edwin Powell Hubble published a short article in which he demonstrated that galaxies are moving away from each other: it was an idea that supported the expanding Universe theory of Lemaître.\n",
      "Another source of support for Lemaître’s theory came almost 20 years later in 1948 when an American physicist of Ukrainian origin, George Gamow, began to publish alone, and then with colleagues, a series of articles describing the events that took place during the first few moments after the Big Bang explosion.\n",
      "According to Gamow, the Universe was like an extremely hot \"energy soup\" that rapidly cooled enough to allow the first atomic nuclei of hydrogen and helium to form.\n",
      "Gamow’s work thus explained the long-standing mystery of why the Universe contains 99% hydrogen and helium.\n",
      "Gamow and his colleagues proposed that a glow permeated the early Universe when those first atoms were created, and that even today—13 billion years later—we should be able to detect this residual glow as radio waves from across the Universe.\n",
      "The world of astronomy was in for a remarkable revelation in 1965 when American physicists Arno Allan Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson somewhat serendipitously detected a weak radio signal coming from all directions of the cosmos at once: the famous cosmic background radiation predicted by Gamow.\n",
      "Penzias and Wilson went on to receive the 1978 Nobel Prize for Physics for their discovery that helped prove the Big Bang theory.\n",
      "The dramatic early moments of the Universe can be summed up as follows:\n",
      "In the beginning, the Universe we observe today was concentrated into a single minuscule point.\n",
      "It was only once it exploded simultaneously in all directions during a tiny fraction of a second that space was created and time began to flow.\n",
      "Our current understanding of the beginning of the Universe starts 10 millionths of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a second (10-43 seconds) after the Big Bang.\n",
      "The Universe expanded somewhat slowly at this point, but its temperature was extraordinarily high: at least 100,000 billion billion billion (1032) degrees.\n",
      "The cooling rate was extremely rapid, however, and only 100 billionth of a second later, its temperature had already dropped to 100 billion (1011) degrees!\n",
      "A spectacular event then occurred: the size of the Universe abruptly multiplied by 1050 times (that’s 100 billion trillion trillion, or a 1 followed by 50 zeroes).\n",
      "The Universe was still extremely hot so the particles were much too agitated to combine with each other and form atoms.\n",
      "All this would change 300,000 years after the Big Bang when the temperature of the Universe had fallen to a mere 3,000 degrees.\n",
      "At this temperature, the movements of subatomic particles were sufficiently slow that the first atoms could finally form.\n",
      "Electrons—which up to this point had been spending their existence capturing and releasing photons—were now tied up with atomic nuclei (protons and neutrons) to create these first atoms.\n",
      "Finally freed from their struggle with the electrons, photons began to move throughout space to create the earliest light energy: cosmic background radiation.\n",
      "Video sequence   Hubert Reeves explains that the Universe has a history.\n",
      "Astronomers Space Time The arrangement of matter The arrangement of matter As the Universe cooled, matter became more complex After the Big Bang, the temperature of the Universe continually dropped as matter organized itself into increasingly complex forms.\n",
      "At the grand scale, the cosmos was initially filled with a homogenous gas consisting mainly of light chemical elements.\n",
      "At long last, the Universe ceased to be dark as it began to fill with stars that would eventually combine to form galaxies.\n",
      "It was in the core of these first stars (and all stars since then) that heavier chemical elements—like carbon, oxygen, silicon and iron—began to form via nuclear reactions.\n",
      "At the end of each star’s life cycle, these \"new\" chemical elements were released into space where they enriched the clouds of interstellar gas.\n",
      "Gravitational forces eventually regrouped the matter in these clouds to create a new generation of stars.\n",
      "The life cycle of stars is responsible for adding all kinds of chemical elements to the Universe.\n",
      "Under very special conditions, it is even possible for atoms in the space between stars to combine with other atoms and form simple molecules, or even complex molecules like amino acids.\n",
      "Some stars gain planets after being born.\n",
      "Planets can be terrestrial (that is, made mainly of metal and rock like the Earth and Mars), whereas others are made mostly of gases, like Jupiter and Saturn, or ice, which is probably the case for Pluto.\n",
      "The Earth is a peculiar case because water can exist in liquid form.\n",
      "Thanks to this simple fact, it was possible for organic molecules (those consisting of carbon atoms) to arrange in complex enough patterns to allow life to form.\n",
      "Although we are fairly certain that life began on Earth at least 3 billion 800 years ago, we still know very little about the conditions that allowed life to originate.\n",
      "Astronomers Equipment and preparation How does a star finder work?\n",
      "Equipment and preparation Astronomy is both a science and a pastime that can be practiced using only basic equipment and without being an expert The rewards of astronomy were never more accessible than they are today.\n",
      "The recent profusion of spectacular images, the explosion of knowledge and technical possibilities, the ubiquitous presence of the Internet, and the widespread accessibility to equipment have catapulted popular astronomy into a new era.\n",
      "Astronomy can be practiced during the day or night.\n",
      "In the daytime, it is possible to observe the Moon, several planets, and our own star, the Sun.\n",
      "It is dangerous to view the Sun directly.\n",
      "Instead, you should project its image onto a cardboard screen using binoculars or a telescope, or install special filters onto a telescope before looking through it.\n",
      "Solar spots, which are dark regions on the Sun’s surface, are easily seen when viewing the Sun using these methods.\n",
      "Bring a notebook and pencil to take notes.\n",
      "A flashlight with a red filter will help you see your way in the dark without blinding your friends or yourself.\n",
      "Now that you are all set up, familiarize yourself with the constellations using only your eyes: constellations help guide us to the celestial objects we wish to observe.\n",
      "Once you have learned to orient yourself, binoculars will be very helpful – even professional astronomers commonly use them.\n",
      "Mounted on a tripod, binoculars provide magnificent celestial vistas, revealing the topography of the Moon, the moons of Jupiter, a good number of nebulas, and even some galaxies.\n",
      "At some point, you will want to add a refracting or reflecting telescope to push your observations to the next level.\n",
      "The most important feature of a telescope is its optical precision of its optical components.\n",
      "Look for well-known brands that have established and reliable reputations.\n",
      "Newtonian-type telescopes are generally more affordable due to their simple design.\n",
      "At the other end of the spectrum are amateur telescopes that are as powerful as those used by professionals thanks to computers and CCD cameras.\n",
      "In some cases, the telescope can be left outside while you make your observations from inside, comfortably seated in front of your computer.\n",
      "Luckily for those who do not own a telescope, there are many astronomy clubs with members who share a passion for space and are more than happy to let others look through their telescopes.\n",
      "Do not hesitate to contact an astronomy club: the people are invariably a very welcoming bunch.\n",
      "How does a star finder work?\n",
      "An indispensable sky map A star finder (also known as a planisphere) is a circular map with an overlay that turns to show – through an opening in the overlay – the region of the sky that is visible for a specified time, date and location.\n",
      "It is an incredibly useful tool for orienting yourself in the night sky, for identifying constellations, and for planning your stargazing night.\n",
      "For southern Canada, a star finder designed for 45E north is sufficient.\n",
      "The way a star finder works is simple.\n",
      "The days and months of the year are shown around the edge of a circular base, and the hours of the day are displayed around the overlay.\n",
      "By turning the overlay to line up the time of your observations with the date, the portion o the sky that is visible will appear through the opening in the overlay.\n",
      "All that remains is to hold the star finder over your head and orient it with respect to North.\n",
      "Instructions The activity simulates a real star search.\n",
      "Simply click the hour you want and then drag the mouse over the circle in the middle and indicate the date and precise hour that you intend to search the sky overhead.\n",
      "A precise representation of the sky at that precise moment may be viewed onscreen.\n",
      "Use the star searcher to pinpoint stars, constellations and planets precisely.\n",
      "Then wait for a starry night to use your star searcher to locate the constellations and stars that fill our sky.\n",
